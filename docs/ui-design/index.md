# UI Design

## Wireframe

These are the Wireframe designs for the login page, map selection pages, and review pages. 

Here is the login page:
![Wireframe 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71744611/229268937-cb5bc82b-8bd0-41c1-853b-b1f014c32f9b.png)


Not much to say here, other than that it uses a very recognizable format used by many other websites (see the 'Sign up' and 'Forgot Password?'). Users should have no trouble with this page. 

Let's say we have a new user. After signing up and logging in, they'll be prompted to select their place of residence.


This is the first map page: 
![Wireframe 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71744611/229268950-57875023-028d-4538-b7b5-a1298bc9c4f7.png)

All the living areas are shown and highlighted. Let's say this user is living in the Southwest residential area and selects it.


This is the second map page:
![Wireframe 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71744611/229268957-db921b83-61a1-446b-a23a-741d5dd607af.png)

The next map page zeroes into the actual dorm buildings in the selected area, also highlighted. Our user selects and confirms that they will be living in the John Adams dorm and decides that they want to check the reviews.


This is the first dorm ratings page:
![Wireframe 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71744611/229268961-2f1911ac-1930-4148-bb60-25a538f20d69.png)

Here, the user can view the ratings for 4 different criteria: overall, cleanliness, accessibility, and dorm culture. What if they want to see more? Perhaps some comments/reasoning/complaints/etc. Let's say our user is very interested in the dorm culture and clicks on the words.


This is the second dorm ratings page:
![Wireframe 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71744611/229268980-6a89bdd3-e1bf-4f3a-bee1-faf2c15e3382.png)

This second page lists all the reviewers, the stars they gave, and their written review. After looking for a while, the user is satisfied and wants to check out the app's other features. They locate and click on the universal menu button on the top right corner.


This is the second dorm ratings page, but with the sidebar extended:
![Wireframe 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71744611/229268989-ae5ddd12-3829-4663-a82d-32c58df775c7.png)

Here, the user can access their profile, return to the main menu, the reviews page, the forums page, and the Dirty Laundry general chat.


## Stories

### Story 1

Alicia is an outgoing sophomore that has just started living in the Northeast Area. She wants to have casual online conversations and arrange get-togethers with people close by. She loads up UMass Dormitory Forumitory on her phone and switches to the general chat to post greetings to other students that live in the same area. Very quickly, she makes a few new friends that agree to meet her in the commons.

### Story 2

Ryan is a freshman and new to the Sylvan area. He wants to search/ask for advice on how to get accustomed to the area, as well as check for any new events, get warnings about laundry thieves, and vice versa. He registers into UMass Dormitory Forumitory and checks the forum page for these topics. In particular, he searches for news about laundry and discovers that there has indeed been someone going around exclusively stealing socks. He starts another discussion on how to handle laundry in the face of this threat and he receives advice from others that have experienced it before.

### Story 3

Lucky is a senior that has finished their last semester in the Central Area and wants to express their strongly-worded complaints. They log onto UMass Dormitory Forumitory, which they have been using to express opinions about their other residential experiences, and write a review. They complain about the dirty bathrooms, noisy neighbors, and terrible buildings. New students see the review and take it into consideration when deciding their residence.
